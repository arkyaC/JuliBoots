JuliBoots
=========

A Julia-based package for performing numerical conformal bootstrap computations. Includes an arbitrary precision simplex solver for finite or continuously infinite search spaces, a branch and bound global function minimizer, and a package for working with rational functions. The mathematica notebooks ComputeTable (which use Tables.nb and Tables.m) may be used to compute derivatives of conformal blocks at z=1/2 with arbitrary external dimensions.
