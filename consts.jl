### BRANCH AND BOUND

BB_NEWTON_GOAL=1e-30      # Accuracy in determination of minimum during branch and bound
BB_ISGOOD=0.07     # when to determine if an interval is good; decreasing this parameter reduces the number of "domain error Newton"
BB_ITERMAX=50       # When to stop Newton's method

### LP

DELTAMAX=BigFloat(100)        # maximum \Delta
FUDGE=BigFloat(1e-90)         # Used for: not evaluating things exactly at unitarity bound for L=0;
                              # Also plays the role of zero components in things like global symmetry bounds.
VERBOSE=false                 # whether to print timings
# File System
LPFILE="./LPLog.txt"


LP_STOPGOAL=BigFloat(1e-7)       # Linear problem will stop optimization if relative cost variation will be
LP_STOPITERS=100       # smaller or equal to LP_STOPGOAL for LP_STOPITER iterations in a row



### BOOTSTRAP

LP_ITERMAX=100000 #when to stop looking for a solution during bissection.
CULLPOLES=BigFloat(1e-30) #poles whose coefficients are smaller than this will be ommitted (roughly). Used in setupLP.

### LU

LU_FUDGE=BigFloat(1e-5000) #used when checking if there's a non-zero pivot
